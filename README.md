# NCC 2022 RAG Building Advisor

## Background

This project was created to address a common challenge faced by architects and construction professionals in Australia: quickly and accurately finding relevant information within the National Construction Code (NCC). My partner, an architect, often expressed frustration with the difficulty of navigating the dense and complex NCC documents to get timely advice.

This application is a learning project that demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to make the NCC more accessible. It uses a Flask web framework for the frontend and a parent-child chunking strategy to improve the quality of the retrieved information.

## How it Works

The application works in the following steps:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The application first ingests the NCC 2022 Volumes 1, 2, and 3 in PDF format.
2.  **Parent-Child Chunking:** To improve the relevance of the retrieved context, the documents are split into two levels of chunks:
    * **Parent Chunks:** Larger, more general chunks of text (e.g., 2000 characters).
    * **Child Chunks:** Smaller, more specific chunks derived from the parent chunks (e.g., 400 characters).
3.  **Vectorization:** The child chunks are then converted into numerical representations (embeddings) using a sentence transformer model and stored in a Chroma vector database. The parent chunks are stored separately.
4.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the application queries the vector database to find the most relevant child chunks.
5.  **Context Augmentation:** The application then retrieves the parent chunks associated with the top-ranked child chunks. This provides a broader and more complete context for the language model.
6.  **Generation:** Finally, the user's question and the retrieved parent chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a human-readable answer.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Download the NCC 2022 PDFs:**
    * Create a directory named `ncc_pdfs`.
    * Download the NCC 2022 Volumes 1, 2, and 3 from the [official ABCB website](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/editions/ncc-2022).
    * Place the downloaded PDF files in the `ncc_pdfs` directory.
4.  **Run the Gradio application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
5.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
